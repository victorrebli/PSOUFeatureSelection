# PSOUFeatureSelection

Particle swarm Optmization(PSO) simulates the social behaviour such as birds flockingand fish schooling. In PSO, a population, also called a swarm, of can-didate solutions are encoded as particles in the search space. PSOstarts with the random initialisation of a population of particles.Particles move in the search space to search for the optimal solutionby updating the position of each particle based on the experienceof its own and its neighbouring particles
